### Business Problem Overview

Microsoft, an American multinational technology company that produces computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services headquartered at the Microsoft Redmond campus located in Redmond, Washington, United States, wishes to enter the movie industry as a strategic company objective given the high returns of companies in this industry.

The problem for Microsoft is that they do not know how to analyze vast amount of data residing in a collection of databases available to gain insight into the market. They wish to collect, prepare,  and extract valuable business insights from these databases that will help them make great tactical initial decisions. Decisions for example, as to what type of movies should they initially support and why.And, if once supported, when would it be a good time to promote and publish these films. Given the vast amount of data available in databases about movies, they really need help from a data scientist firm that can help them overcome their challenge, and realize the beggining steps of their strategic objective. 

Fortunately for Microsoft, the best data scientists consulting companies in the world have started to form. One of them, and probably the most reliable,is Pandas Soldiers Data Science Inc. run by one man, CEO Jhonathan David Herrera-Shaikh, a leader in this field. Microsoft turns to him for help them acquire information so that they can intelligently invest their dollars with the highest chance of being successful 

Here in this presentation, therefore I will gain access to available databasases and the moviesinformation in it. I have to find information that would be relevant for Microsoft executives to enter the market. I'll first find descriptive information about movies in the movie industry. Second, I will decide which data factors are the most relevant and can have the most value for decision making. Third,  I'll make an analysis on the data and provide insight and analytical findings while finally I will recommend the 3 best course of actions recommendations for the business exectives in the initial stages of their strategic objective. ### The Data

Databases:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)



### Recommendations

My analysis of the movie industry, achieved by munching data and utilizing visualizations on the databases for analysis, showed three main business relevant insights for business decision making and are as follows: 

1. Microsoft should focus on understanding their competition,  the top 5 market share holders their revenue streams preparing business strategies for both the domestic and foreign markets as the top market share holders recognize revenue from both streams.

2. Microsoft is first focus on 3 main genres initially, Drama, Action, Adventure and Comedy (possibly Thrillers as fourth one). This because there is more information and most sales for genre type, and we should start production knowing where to focus. Now that we know this, since Microsoft knows now begin, the next step is discovering more about them. I also recommend to approach getting to know these genres further, extracting databases specifically for these genre types to extract detailed value as to what factors influence these genres.

 3. Microsoft is first focus  Adventure and Action productions, and consider Musicals. This because the worldwide gross in these  genre types provide the highest opportunity of worldwide gross earnings.  Now that we know this, since Microsoft wants to be profitable and drive up revenues, we now now where that is likely to occur.  I also recommend to approach getting to know these genres further, extracting databases specifically for these genre types to extract detailed value as to what factors influence these genres.
